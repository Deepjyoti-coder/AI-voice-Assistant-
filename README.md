This project marks my introduction to the world of computer vision using OpenCV and Python. The goal was to familiarize myself with foundational concepts in image processing, and apply them through hands-on coding tasks. Highlights of this project include:

Reading and displaying images using OpenCV

Performing basic image transformations (resizing, cropping, rotation)

Applying classic filters and edge detection techniques

Annotating and drawing shapes on images

Experimenting with color space conversion

Through this experience, I strengthened my understanding of key OpenCV functions and Python libraries. This project is a stepping stone towards more advanced computer vision applications such as face detection, object tracking, and real-time video analysis.
